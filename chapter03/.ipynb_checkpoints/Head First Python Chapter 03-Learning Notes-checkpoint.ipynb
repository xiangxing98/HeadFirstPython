    "## 知识要点\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 使用open()内置函数打开磁盘文件并创建一个迭代器来每次从文件中读取一行数据；\n",
    "2. readline()方法从一个打开的文件中读取一行数据；\n",
    "3. seek()方法可以将文件重新定位到开头；\n",
    "4. close()方法关闭上一次打开的文件；\n",
    "5. split()方法将一个字符串分为许多份组成的列表；\n",
    "6. Python中不可改变的常量list叫做tuple。一旦列表数据复制给一个tuple之后，tuple中的数据将不能再被改变。Tuple是不能变的(immutable);\n",
    "7. 当数据与期望的格式有出入时，会产生ValueError；\n",
    "8. 当数据没法被正确访问时（例如数据文件可能已经移动过或者重命名过），会产生IOError；\n",
    "9. help()内置函数提供在IDLE shell中访问Python文档；\n",
    "10. find()方法可以在一个字符串中查找特定子串；\n",
    "11. not关键字用来否定一个条件；\n",
    "12. try/except语句提供了异常处理机制，可以保护那些可能导致运行时错误的代码段；\n",
    "13. pass语句是Python中的空语句，它什么都不做。\n"
